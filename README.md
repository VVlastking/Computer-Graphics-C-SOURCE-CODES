# Computer-Graphics-C-SOURCE-CODES
This repository contains the c++ source codes for algorithms taught in the course computer graphics, namely line drawing algorithms(dda,bresenham,midpoint),circle,ellipse,liang barsky clipping algorithm,2-d transformation and filling algorithms. All the codes have been implemented using OpenGL/GLUT.
